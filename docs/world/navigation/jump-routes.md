# Jump Routes

Established navigation corridors recognised by civilian navigation systems.
All routes are bidirectional. Distances are in light years.

Route data lives entirely in the front matter above — the docs renderer and
game engine read from there. Add new routes as front matter entries only;
do not duplicate them here as tables or diagrams.

Only systems with a doc in `docs/world/systems/` may be referenced. No orphan
route entries.
